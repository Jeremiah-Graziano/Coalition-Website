### Practice Website 

I made this website which is a skills test for a company I applied at, and liked the design of the website. It touched really well with alot of good frontend practices utilizing HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript while able to also impliment Bootsraps grid system and good use of media queries. Overall a great project.
