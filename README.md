### Practice Website 

I made this website, which is a skills test for a company I applied at, and liked the design of the website. It touched really well with many good frontend practices utilizing HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript while also being able to implement Bootstrap's grid system and good use of media queries. Overall, it is a great project.
